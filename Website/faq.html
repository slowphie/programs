          <h2>General</h2>
          <p class='question'>
            Q Is there an age limit?</p>
          <p class='answer'>
            A If you have a passion for music and an appreciation for nature, there is no limit for our lessons. We teach any age, we would say from ages 5-95, but that is too restrictive for those outside that age bracket. Although, for hiring our spaces for practicing, children under the age of 16 must have adult supervision (over 18 years of age).
          </p><br>
          <p class='question'>
            Q How do I pay for my lessons or space hiring?</p>
          <p class='answer'>
            A When you book your lesson or hire your space, we will send a confirmation and include the price and any extra details. You can pay on the day by cash or card, or internet bank us in advance.
          </p><br>

          <h2>Lessons</h2>
          <p class='question'>
            Q If I can not make it to my lesson, can I rearrange a lesson time?</p>
          <p class='answer'>
            A Yes, given 24 hours of notice, we can organise a full refund or arrange another time that would suit you. If you wish to reschedule a time with less that 24 hours notice, we may charge you 50% of the lesson fee, depending on your circumstances.
          </p><br>
          <p class='question'>
            Q Am I required to regularly attend lessons or can I book a lesson as one-off experience? 
          </p>
          <p class='answer'>
            A We have options that charge by the hour of lesson. therefore there is no requirement for continually returning to lessons. We understand that many of our customers are simply looking for an experience to immerse themselves in music and New Zealand nature, so by all means you can join us for one session.
          </p><br>
          <p class='question'>
            A Do you supply instruments?
          </p>
          <p class='answer'>
            Q Yes, all of our teachers can supply the instruments they teach if required. We suggest you bring your own as it may feel more familiar, this is not a necessity as we understand it may be a hassle to bring your own double bass, for instance. 
          </p><br>
          <p class='question'>
            A How much experience is required for these lessons?
          </p>
          <p class='answer'>
            Q Our teachers are trained to teach students of all levels. This can range from zero to a great amount of experience. You might wish to just give a new instrument a go, therefore prior experience is not needed. We have customers learning at all levels, so our teacher are very accomodating to your learning ability and style to ensure you get the most out of your lesson.
          </p><br>

          <h2>Locations</h2>
          <p class='question'>
            Q What happens if it is raining on the day of my lesson?
          </p>
          <p class='answer'>
            A If it is raining, we offer a few different options. Most of our locations have modern glass shelters, where you can appreciate the view under the protection of the roof and still receive your lesson. The locations that do not have this you can have your lesson in our office studio room at 50% of the cost or you can reschedule your lesson time free of charge.
          </p><br>
          <p class='question'>
            Q Do your locations have dangerous animals, like bears?
          </p>
          <p class='answer'>
            A This is New Zealand, we don't have bears. The only dangerous creatures you may come across are spiders, but they're probably just there to enjoy the lovely music you are producing. 
          </p><br>
          <p class='question'>
            Q Can I hire out a location for my own practice, or for a performance?
          </p>
          <p class='answer'>
            A Yes, as listed on our locations information page, you can hire a space from anywhere between 30 minutes to a full day. This has the same rules as lessons when it comes to cancellations, you must contact us with greater that 24 hours notice to gain a full refund of the hiring cost. For performances, our locations can accomodate between 10-40 maximum people, we do not supply any seating to assist with this, you must bring your own.
