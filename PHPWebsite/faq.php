			<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
			<h3>What is the flying time of the trip to Italy?</h3>
			<p>That is a difficult question to answer. The flying time ranges from 23 hours 30 minutes, to 38 hours 15 minutes, depending on the amount of fuel in the plane.</p><br>
			<h3>What food do you offer?</h3>
			<p>We offer three meals throughout the flight. Cereal and milk for breakfast, pasta for lunch and steak for dinner. The cost is included in your ticket price. We unfortunately do not offer any vegetarian or vegan options, neither do we offer any dairy or gluten free meals. We apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused.</p><br>	
			<h3>Can I skydive out of the plane?</h3>
			<p>No. Please, do not.</p><br>	
			<h3>Can I bring my wombat with me on the plane? We have a special connection and I simply cannot leave poor Bruce behind.</h3>
			<p>Sadly, Itlay does not accept wombats into the country. However, we happily allow all First Class passenger animals on board. This does mean you will have to leave your wombat on the plane during your time in Italy. We should also remind you that our flights are only one way, so leaving your wombat on the plane means you will have to see him on your next trip to Italy, but it still does not necessarily mean you can take him home with you. So, we recommend not bringing your pet wombat. Although, Italy's national animal is accepted into the country, so if you have a wolf you wish to bring, he may accompany you on your journey. (We are not responsible for any troubles you may have on departing the country via other airlines with your wolf)</p><br>
			<h3>How many crashes has Volare Airlines had?</h3>
			<p>None. We assure you none. Well, maybe one back in 1998, however we have upgraded our safety, and do not intend on having another crash any time soon.</p>
