			<h2>Our Destinations</h2>
			<p>Volare Airlines offers a wide range of destinations for your next holiday. If you have travelled with us before then you have most likely visited this place before, as we only offer the one, but why not fly there again? </p>
			<h3>Italy</h3>
			Italy is our most popular destination that our customers choose. Italy, a European country with a long Mediterranean coastline, has left a powerful mark on Western culture and cuisine. Its capital, Rome, is home to the Vatican as well as landmark art and ancient ruins. Other major cities include Florence, with Renaissance masterpieces such as Michelangelo’s "David" and Brunelleschi's Duomo; Venice, the city of canals; and Milan, Italy’s fashion capital. We fly into Leonardo da Vinci International Airport or simply Rome Fiumicino Airport, also known as just Fiumicino Airport, where you must find your own transport to the other major cities. Our travels are one way, so once you arrive in Italy you must find other transport to depart the beautiful country. With Italian roots in Volare Airlines, we are passionate about all Italy has to offer, and encourage you to plan your next holiday with us.
